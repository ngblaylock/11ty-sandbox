This is a second blog post. I really like it. I think it would be a really good blogging platform to use someday for some reason.

And here is another one.

We should try a table...

<div class="--table">

| Name   | Age | Hobby              |
| ------ | --- | ------------------ |
| Nathan | 29  | Woodworking        |
| Brian  | 32  | Weather Forcasting |
| Rachel | 26  | Shopping           |

</div>

Here is a [link](/assets/android-chrome-192x192.png). It may not be pretty, but it is fine.

<script>
  $('.--table table').addClass('table');
</script>
